      Checking out how git tracks the changes I make in another program.
    </p>
    <p>
      By changing the branch via the terminal the program running my current project automatically is switched to the version that resides on a new git branch.
    </p>

      Your copy on your computer hardrive is separate from the versions that are stored within your local and global git repositories.
    </p>

      Think of it like having two separate bookshelevs with the same books but one can be thrown out but you would still have the copies of the same books elsewhere.
